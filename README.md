Welcome to PracticeProjects, a personal repository containing hands-on data analysis and visualization projects using Excel and Tableau. 
These exercises demonstrate pivot tables, data modeling, 3D maps, and other foundational skills essential for real-world data exploration. More projects will be added as I continue to learn and grow.

📁 Project Structure

🔹 3D Maps & Pivot Tables – King County Food Inspection Data
This project explores public health data from King County to highlight inspection statuses and risk levels of restaurants across different locations in Washington State.

PT-NO CONFIRM Pivot:
Displays restaurants with "Not Confirmed" inspection results.
Fields: Restaurant name, inspection date, address, business ID, seating/risk info, phone number.

PT-S>250-RC1 Pivot:
Identifies the number of restaurants with 250+ seating capacity and Risk Category 1.

PM-NOT READY:
3D Map visualizing restaurants in Seattle that are "Not Ready for Inspection".

PM - EASTSIDE NR:
3D Map visualizing "Not Ready for Inspection" inspection statuses in Bellevue, Mercer Island, Redmond, Sammamish, and Woodinville.

PM Pivot:
Rearranges raw data to make it compatible with Power Map (3D Maps).

🔹 Pivot Table Data Fields – Herb Sales Dataset
Summarizing and analyzing herb sales using standard pivot tables.

Quarterly Analysis:
Displays average sales per quarter for 5 different herbs.

Yearly Analysis:
Shows yearly average sales from 2001 to 2005.

Product-Wise Analysis:
Compares average sales by herb and includes a grand average.

Recommended Pivot:
Highlights annual total sales for basil leaf, using conditional formatting:

Bold for values ≥ $80,000

Color-coded for easy comparison


🔹 Pivot Table Data Model – Hotel Booking Data
This project emphasizes relational data modeling within Excel using multiple tables and relationships.

Customers, Reservations, and Rooms sheets are converted into structured Excel Tables Initially.

Define Relationships:

Link Customers ↔ Reservations and Rooms ↔ Reservations via key fields using Excel's Data Model.

PivotTable 1:
Find all customers with bookings in March.

PivotTable 2:
List reservation values > $500 and associated room type.

PivotChart 1:
Pivot chart that shows reservation value total by country.
